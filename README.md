# Liri_Node_App Week 10 homework assignment 

### Description

LIRI is a node app.  LIRI is like SIRI but instead of speeech, LIRI responds to specific language inputs on the command line.

### How To Use Liri

LIRI is very particular about how you make requests of him.  Yes LIRI is also a boy and despite being spelled LIRI it is actually pronounced Larry.  

LIRI will search for songs, movies, and concerts if you ask him the right way.  Otherwise, he will not be very helpful.

There are four phrases that LIRI understands and they must be typed exactly as they are shown below:
    
    1. spotify-this-song 'name of song here'
    2. concert-this 'name of band or artist here'
    3. movie-this 'name of movie here'
    4. do-what-it-says

The first command will take the name of a song and search spotify and return the name of the artist, the name of the song, a link to a thirty second spotify preview of the track and the album that the song can be found on.

The second command will search the Bands In Town API and return any upcoming shows for the artist that is being searched for including, the venue, the location and the date of the concert.

The third command will search OMDB for data for the requested movie title and return the following information:
    
    1. Title of the movie.
    2. Year the movie came out.
    3. IMDB Rating of the movie.
    4. Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
    5. Country where the movie was produced.
    6. Language of the movie.
    7. Plot of the movie.
    8. Actors in the movie.

The fourth request will pick a random song, artist or movie to return data for from a list curated by the developer.
